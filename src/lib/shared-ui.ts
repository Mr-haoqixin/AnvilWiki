/**
 * Shared UI strings helper — one lookup for the `shared` namespace.
 *
 * Every component that needs cross-page labels (ad labels, copy feedback,
 * video a11y text, …) used to repeat the same three-line lookup dance, each
 * copy re-asserting the result past the type system with a double-hop cast.
 * Six drifted copies later, the lookup lives here. Call it from a
 * component's frontmatter:
 *
 *   import { currentSharedStrings } from '~/lib/shared-ui';
 *   const sharedStrings = currentSharedStrings(Astro.currentLocale);
 *
 * The result is typed as `Partial<SharedUi>` — the real en.json structure,
 * every key optional. Non-wiki locales (landing-only htmlLangs like zh —
 * they have no locale JSON) get an empty object, so every caller keeps its
 * own English `??` fallback; a typo'd key fails typecheck instead of
 * silently rendering `undefined`. Pure function of the locale — no
 * component imports here (lib must never import from src/components, that
 * would be circular).
