/**
 * Affiliate suggestions — config-driven monetization slot (v2.0).
 *
 * 👉 APPLY TEMPLATE: put YOUR affiliate picks here (Steam store page, game
 * pass, peripherals…). This is part of the CONFIG LAYER — the component
 * (src/components/ads/AffiliateSuggestion.astro) reads from here, never the
 * reverse.
 *
 * Empty by design: with no suggestions configured the end-of-article slot
 * renders NOTHING (same out-of-box contract as ads/comments/sponsor — keeps
 * Lighthouse 4×100 and fork sites clean). Unlike AdSense this is NOT env
 * gated: affiliate links are per-game content data, not deployment secrets.
